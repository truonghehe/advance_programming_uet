## instruction: 
use the mouse as a nevigator. hold the mouse to see the direction where the ball will go and release the mouse to shoot the ball.

## game update:
to add level, you need to create a new even number level in golf.cpp, then create an array, add block in it and check for collision like i did.

if there are problems about collision, to fix it open the ball_util.cpp and check for errors.

all of the png pictures i used is in the "stuff" folder, if you want to add more function, please put png pictures in the folder.
